In my CSE219 class I designed and constructed a software called Animated Sprite Editor: 
a Animated Sprite Editing Tool that allows user to design their own sprite and animate them. 
More specification can be found in the software manual

2.Decomposing problems into modular designs with simple, narrow interfaces.
3.Determining the proper objects in an object-oriented design.
4.Selecting appropriate algorithms and data structures.
5.Reusing code, including external libraries designed and built by others.
6.Learning systematic testing and debugging techniques.
